# Hi! I'm Alex Muli
Iâ€™m a Computer Science graduate with 5 years of experience in software development: both 
web and mobile. Am also well experienced in Artificial Intelligence including building and 
training machine learning models. I have proven track record as a freelancer and technical 
specialist, delivering high-quality solutions for diverse clients. Strong analytical skills, 
problem-solving abilities, and a passion for leveraging data to drive insights and 
innovation. I'm looking for opportunities to put my vast skills into practice and expand my skillset too.
